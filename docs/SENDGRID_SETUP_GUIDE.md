   - **Suppressions**: Read Access
6. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "PMS Production API Key")
7. Copy the API key (starts with `SG.`)

### 3. Domain Authentication (Highly Recommended)

For production use, authenticate your domain for better deliverability:

1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **Authenticate Your Domain**
3. Choose your DNS provider
4. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
5. Follow the DNS configuration instructions
6. Add the provided DNS records to your domain
7. Click **Verify** once DNS records are propagated

**DNS Records Example:**
```
CNAME: em1234.yourdomain.com ‚Üí u1234567.wl123.sendgrid.net
CNAME: s1._domainkey.yourdomain.com ‚Üí s1.domainkey.u1234567.wl123.sendgrid.net
CNAME: s2._domainkey.yourdomain.com ‚Üí s2.domainkey.u1234567.wl123.sendgrid.net
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env.local` file:

```bash

```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `SG.your_actual_api_key_here` with your actual SendGrid API key
- Replace `yourdomain.com` with your authenticated domain
- For development, you can use `noreply@sendgrid.net` as the FROM address

Webhooks provide real-time delivery tracking:

1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
2. Click **Create new webhook**
