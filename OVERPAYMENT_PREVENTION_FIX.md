# Overpayment Prevention Fix ✅

## Problem
A guest was able to pay ₹4,700 for a room that costs ₹2,200/night (₹4,400 for 2 nights). This should never be allowed - once a reservation is fully paid, no additional payments should be accepted for the same room/reservation.

## Root Cause
The payment API endpoint (`/api/reservations/[id]/payment`) was accepting any payment amount without validating that it doesn't exceed the total reservation amount. There was no check to prevent overpayment.

## Solution - 3 Changes

### 1. Backend Validation (API Endpoint)
**File:** `src/app/api/reservations/[id]/payment/route.ts`

Added validation to reject payments that exceed the total reservation amount:

```typescript
// Validate that payment doesn't exceed total reservation amount
if (newTotalPaid > totalReservationAmount) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    {
      error: `Payment amount exceeds reservation total. Total due: ₹${totalReservationAmount.toFixed(2)}, Already paid: ₹${totalPaid.toFixed(2)}, Remaining: ₹${(totalReservationAmount - totalPaid).toFixed(2)}`
    },
    { status: 400 }
  );
}
```

**Result:** API rejects overpayments with a clear error message showing:
- Total due amount
- Already paid amount
- Remaining balance

### 2. Frontend Validation (Cash Payment Handler)
**File:** `src/components/bookings/edit-tabs/EditPaymentTab.tsx`

Added validation in `handleCashPaymentSave()` to prevent recording cash payments when balance is ≤ 0:

```typescript
// Validate that remaining balance is positive
if (totals.remainingBalance <= 0) {
  toast.error(
    "No outstanding balance to pay. All charges have been settled."
  );
  return;
}
```

**Result:** User cannot record cash payment if all charges are settled.

### 3. UI Feedback (Payment Method Options)
**File:** `src/components/bookings/edit-tabs/EditPaymentTab.tsx`

Updated the Make Payment section to show a success message when all charges are settled:

```typescript
{totals.remainingBalance <= 0 ? (
  <div className="p-4 bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 rounded-lg border border-green-200 dark:border-green-700">
    <p className="text-sm text-green-800 dark:text-green-200">
      <strong>✓ All charges settled.</strong> No outstanding balance to pay.
    </p>
  </div>
) : (
  // Show payment method options
)}
```

**Result:** Clear visual feedback that all charges are settled.

## Data Flow

```
User tries to pay ₹4,700 for ₹4,400 room
    ↓
Frontend validates: remainingBalance > 0?
    ↓ (if ≤ 0)
Show error: "No outstanding balance to pay"
    ↓ (if > 0)
Send payment to API
    ↓
API validates: newTotalPaid > totalReservationAmount?
    ↓ (if yes)
Return error with breakdown
    ↓ (if no)
Create payment record
```

## Examples

### Scenario 1: Overpayment Attempt
- Room: ₹2,200/night × 2 nights = ₹4,400
- Already paid: ₹0
- User tries to pay: ₹4,700

**Result:** ❌ API rejects with error:
```
Payment amount exceeds reservation total. 
Total due: ₹4,400.00, 
Already paid: ₹0.00, 
Remaining: ₹4,400.00
```

### Scenario 2: Partial Payment Then Overpayment
- Room: ₹2,200/night × 2 nights = ₹4,400
- Already paid: ₹2,000
- User tries to pay: ₹3,000 (total would be ₹5,000)

**Result:** ❌ API rejects with error:
```
Payment amount exceeds reservation total. 
Total due: ₹4,400.00, 
Already paid: ₹2,000.00, 
Remaining: ₹2,400.00
```

### Scenario 3: Correct Full Payment
- Room: ₹2,200/night × 2 nights = ₹4,400
- Already paid: ₹0
- User pays: ₹4,400

**Result:** ✅ Payment accepted, status changes to PAID

### Scenario 4: Trying to Pay After Full Payment
- Room: ₹2,200/night × 2 nights = ₹4,400
- Already paid: ₹4,400
- User tries to pay: ₹100

**Result:** ❌ Frontend shows: "All charges settled. No outstanding balance to pay."

## Security & Business Logic

✅ **Prevents Overpayment:** No guest can pay more than the reservation total
✅ **Clear Error Messages:** Users understand why payment was rejected
✅ **Dual Validation:** Both frontend and backend checks prevent issues
✅ **Audit Trail:** All payment attempts are logged
✅ **Future-Proof:** Works with add-ons when Folio system is implemented

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Try to pay more than room rate - should be rejected
- [ ] Pay exact room rate - should be accepted
- [ ] Try to pay after full payment - should show "All charges settled"
- [ ] Add add-ons and verify remaining balance updates
- [ ] Test with cash, card, and bank transfer methods
- [ ] Verify error messages are clear and helpful
