## Console Logs to Expect

**When opening EditBookingSheet:**
```
📋 Found 1 pending payments
```

**When verifying a payment:**
```
🔵 Verifying payment payment_id...
✅ Payment verified: { id: "...", status: "COMPLETED", processedAt: "...", notes: "..." }
```

## Audit Trail

All verification information is stored in the Payment record:
- **notes:** Verification notes entered by staff

- **status:** Changed from PENDING to COMPLETED

This creates a complete audit trail for compliance and reconciliation purposes.
