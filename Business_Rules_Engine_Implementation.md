# Business Rules Engine Implementation Guide

## üìã **Overview**

The Business Rules Engine is a comprehensive system for dynamic pricing and automated decision making in the Property Management System. It provides intelligent pricing based on real-time market conditions, occupancy rates, demand patterns, and business logic.

## ‚úÖ **Completed Implementation (Task 2.3.1 & 2.3.2)**

### **Core Infrastructure**
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: BusinessRule, RuleExecution, RulePerformance models
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript Types**: Comprehensive type definitions for rules, conditions, actions
- ‚úÖ **Business Rules Engine**: Core evaluation and execution engine
- ‚úÖ **Database Service**: CRUD operations and performance tracking
- ‚úÖ **Pricing Integration**: Connection with existing rates planner
- ‚úÖ **Test API**: Comprehensive testing endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Test UI**: React-based demonstration page

### **Sample Rules Implemented**
1. **Weekend High Demand Pricing** (+25% on weekends with >80% occupancy)
2. **Last Minute Booking Discount** (-15% for bookings <3 days with <60% occupancy)
3. **Early Bird Discount** (-10% for bookings >30 days in advance)
4. **High Demand Surge Pricing** (+40% when occupancy >90%)
5. **Competitive Price Matching** (Match competitor prices when 5%+ below)
6. **Extended Stay Discount** (-20% for stays >7 nights)
7. **Low Season Pricing** (-15% during summer months)
8. **Corporate Rate Discount** (-12% for corporate bookings)
9. **Direct Booking Incentive** (-8% to reduce OTA commissions)
10. **Minimum Price Floor** (Ensures prices never go below ‚Çπ1500)

## üß™ **Testing**

### **Test Page**: `http://localhost:3000/test/business-rules`

**Features:**
- Setup sample rules with one click
- Test multiple pricing scenarios
- View rule performance metrics
- Real-time pricing calculations

**Test Scenarios:**
- Weekend High Occupancy
- Last Minute Low Occupancy  
- Early Bird Booking
- Extended Stay Scenarios

## üîß **Technical Architecture**

### **Core Components**

1. **BusinessRulesEngine** (`src/lib/business-rules/engine.ts`)
   - Rule evaluation and execution
   - Condition matching logic
   - Action application
   - Performance tracking

2. **BusinessRulesService** (`src/lib/business-rules/service.ts`)
   - Database operations
   - Rule validation
   - Performance metrics
   - Bulk operations

3. **PricingIntegrationService** (`src/lib/business-rules/pricing-integration.ts`)
   - Integration with existing rates API
   - Occupancy calculation
   - Demand scoring
   - Price comparison utilities

### **Database Schema**

```sql
-- Business Rules
BusinessRule {
  id, name, description, category, priority
  isActive, isAIGenerated, propertyId, organizationId
  conditions (JSON), actions (JSON), metadata (JSON)
}

-- Execution Tracking
RuleExecution {
  id, ruleId, executedAt, context (JSON)
  result (JSON), success, errorMessage, executionTimeMs
}

-- Performance Metrics
RulePerformance {
  id, ruleId, totalExecutions, successfulExecutions
  avgExecutionTimeMs, totalRevenueImpact, lastExecutedAt
}
```

### **Rule Structure**

```typescript
interface BusinessRule {
  conditions: RuleCondition[]  // When to apply
  actions: RuleAction[]        // What to do
  priority: number            // Execution order
  category: 'PRICING' | 'AVAILABILITY' | 'RESTRICTIONS'
}

interface RuleCondition {
  type: 'occupancy' | 'advance_booking' | 'day_of_week' | ...
  operator: 'greater_than' | 'equals' | 'between' | ...
  value: any
}

interface RuleAction {
  type: 'multiply_price' | 'add_amount' | 'set_minimum_price' | ...
  value: number | object
}
```

## üöÄ **Integration Options**

### **Option 1: Automatic Integration (Recommended)**
Modify existing `/api/rates` endpoint to automatically apply business rules:

```typescript
// Enhanced rates API with business rules
const enhancedPrice = await pricingService.calculateEnhancedPrice({
  roomTypeId,
  propertyId,
  organizationId,
  date,
  lengthOfStay,
  guestType,
  bookingSource
});
```

### **Option 2: Manual Toggle Integration**
Add UI toggle in rates planner to enable/disable rules:
- Compare prices with/without rules
- Gradual rollout capability
- Manual control over rule application

### **Option 3: Property-Level Settings**
Enable/disable business rules per property in settings.

## üìä **Performance & Analytics**

### **Metrics Tracked**
- Total rule executions
- Success/failure rates
- Average execution time
- Revenue impact per rule
- Rule effectiveness trends

### **Performance Monitoring**
- Real-time execution tracking
- Error logging and alerting
- Rule performance analytics
- A/B testing capabilities (future)

## üîÆ **Future AI Integration Path**

### **Phase 1**: Manual Rules (‚úÖ Complete)
- Business-defined pricing rules
- Static condition/action pairs
- Manual rule management

### **Phase 2**: AI-Suggested Rules
- AI analyzes historical data
- Suggests new rules based on patterns
- Human approval required

### **Phase 3**: AI-Optimized Rules
- AI continuously optimizes rule parameters
- Automatic A/B testing
- Performance-based rule adjustment

### **Phase 4**: Fully Autonomous AI Pricing
- Advanced ML models for demand prediction
- Real-time competitive analysis
- Autonomous pricing decisions with human oversight
