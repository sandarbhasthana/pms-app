# Reservation Status System Implementation Plan

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing a reservation status system in the PMS application. The system will handle automatic status transitions based on payments and dates, while also providing manual override capabilities for front desk operations.

## üè® Reservation Status Types

### Primary Status Categories

1. **Confirmation Pending** - Initial state after booking creation
2. **Confirmed** - Payment received, reservation guaranteed
3. **In-House** - Guest has checked in
4. **Checked Out** - Guest has completed stay
5. **No Show** - Guest failed to arrive
6. **Cancelled** - Reservation cancelled by guest or hotel

## üîÑ Status Flow Diagram

```
Booking Created ‚Üí Confirmation Pending ‚Üí Confirmed ‚Üí In-House ‚Üí Checked Out
                                    ‚Üì
                              No Show / Cancelled
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Changes

### Reservation Table Updates

```sql
ALTER TABLE Reservation ADD COLUMN status ENUM(
  'CONFIRMATION_PENDING',
  'CONFIRMED',
  'IN_HOUSE',
  'CHECKED_OUT',
  'NO_SHOW',
  'CANCELLED'
) DEFAULT 'CONFIRMATION_PENDING';

ALTER TABLE Reservation ADD COLUMN checkedInAt TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE Reservation ADD COLUMN checkedOutAt TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE Reservation ADD COLUMN statusUpdatedBy VARCHAR(255) NULL;
ALTER TABLE Reservation ADD COLUMN statusUpdatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE Reservation ADD COLUMN statusChangeReason TEXT NULL;
```

### Status History Table (Audit Trail)

```sql
CREATE TABLE ReservationStatusHistory (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  reservationId INT NOT NULL,
  previousStatus ENUM(...),
  newStatus ENUM(...),
  changedBy VARCHAR(255),
  changeReason TEXT,
  changedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  isAutomatic BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  FOREIGN KEY (reservationId) REFERENCES Reservation(id)
);
```

## üíª TypeScript Implementation

### Enums and Types

```typescript
enum ReservationStatus {
  CONFIRMATION_PENDING = "CONFIRMATION_PENDING",
  CONFIRMED = "CONFIRMED",
  IN_HOUSE = "IN_HOUSE",
  CHECKED_OUT = "CHECKED_OUT",
  NO_SHOW = "NO_SHOW",
  CANCELLED = "CANCELLED"
}

interface StatusUpdatePayload {
  reservationId: string;
  newStatus: ReservationStatus;
  reason?: string;
  updatedBy?: string;
  isAutomatic?: boolean;
}
```

## ü§ñ Automatic Status Management

### Payment-Triggered Updates

- **Same Day Bookings**: Auto check-in when payment completed
- **Future Bookings**: Auto confirm when payment received
- **Scheduled Check-ins**: Daily cron job for confirmed reservations

### Business Logic Rules

```typescript
const autoStatusRules = {
  // Auto-confirm on payment
  onPaymentReceived: (reservation) => {
    if (reservation.paidAmount >= reservation.totalAmount) {
      if (isToday(reservation.checkIn)) {
        updateStatus(reservation.id, "IN_HOUSE");
      } else {
        updateStatus(reservation.id, "CONFIRMED");
      }
    }
  },

  // Daily auto check-in job
  dailyCheckinJob: () => {
    const todayReservations = getConfirmedReservationsForToday();
    todayReservations.forEach((reservation) => {
      if (reservation.paidAmount >= reservation.totalAmount) {
        updateStatus(reservation.id, "IN_HOUSE");
      }
    });
  }
};
```

## üéõÔ∏è Manual Status Management

### Status Transition Rules

```typescript
const allowedTransitions = {
  CONFIRMATION_PENDING: ["CONFIRMED", "CANCELLED"],
  CONFIRMED: ["IN_HOUSE", "NO_SHOW", "CANCELLED"],
  IN_HOUSE: ["CHECKED_OUT"],
  CHECKED_OUT: [], // Final state
  NO_SHOW: ["CONFIRMED"], // Recovery option
  CANCELLED: ["CONFIRMED"] // Reactivation option
};
```

### Front Desk Override Capabilities

- Manual status updates with reason logging
- Bulk status updates for multiple reservations
- Emergency status changes with manager approval
- Status rollback functionality (with restrictions)

## üé® UI/UX Design

### Status Badge System

```typescript
const statusConfig = {
  CONFIRMATION_PENDING: {
    color: "yellow",
    icon: "clock",
    label: "Pending",
    description: "Awaiting confirmation"
  },
  CONFIRMED: {
    color: "blue",
    icon: "check-circle",
    label: "Confirmed",
    description: "Payment received"
  },
  IN_HOUSE: {
    color: "green",
    icon: "home",
    label: "In-House",
    description: "Guest checked in"
  },
  CHECKED_OUT: {
    color: "gray",
    icon: "logout",
    label: "Checked Out",
    description: "Stay completed"
  },
  NO_SHOW: {
    color: "red",
    icon: "x-circle",
    label: "No Show",
    description: "Guest did not arrive"
  },
  CANCELLED: {
    color: "red",
    icon: "ban",
    label: "Cancelled",
    description: "Reservation cancelled"
  }
};
```

### Dashboard Components
